### ESPM-88B: [Data Science in Ecology and the Environment](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b)

- Next offered: **Spring 2016**  
- Course website: [berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b)

*This course is a "connector course" that will be open to freshmen
enrolled in UC Berkeley's [Foundations of Data Science](http://data8.org)
course (DS-8/Stat-94/CS-94).*

Many of the greatest challenges we face today come from understanding
and interacting with the natural world:  from global climate change
to the sudden collapse of fisheries and forests, from the spread of
disease and invasive species to the unknown wealth of medical, cultural,
and technological value we derive from nature.  Advances in satellites
and micro-sensors, computation, informatics and the Internet have
made available unprecedented amounts of data about the natural world,
and with it, new challenges of sifting, processing and synthesizing
large and diverse sources of information. In this course, students will
apply methods and understanding they gain in the Foundations course to
real-world ecological and environmental data sets. Through this hands-on
approach, students will learn more about issues in the natural world
while also developing the practical skills for working with heterogeneous
real-world data encountered in all areas of data science.



### Graduate seminars

**TBD**. Topics in ecoinformatics? Theoretical ecology? Let me know what you'd like to see!
